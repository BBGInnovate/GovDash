##Frequently Asked Questions

**Question:** What Social Media Platforms are currently being tracked?

**Answer:** Facebook, Twitter and Youtube

**Question:** How is the data for the Social Media Dashboard collected, manually or programatically using the Platform APIs?

**Answer:** Programatically using the following APIs
* [Facebook Public APIs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs)
* [Twitter Public APIs](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public)
* [Youtube Analytics APIs] (https://developers.google.com/youtube/analytics/)

**Question:** What are Engagement Actions?

**Answer:** Engagement Actions are an aggregate of 'one-time' user actions taken on an account page or on content posted to a social media platform over a selected date range. For Facebook Pages, engagement actions measure New Fan Page Likes as well as Likes, Comments and Shares on Posts. For Twitter Accounts, New Followers, ReTweets, Favorites and @ Replies are measured. For Youtube Channels, New Subscribers, Video Likes and Comments.

**Question:** How is the data aggregated?

**Answer:** For Facebook Posts, engagement actions are tracked and aggregated over a period of 28 days. For Tweets and Youtube videos, it's 7 days.

**Question:** How do I use the Dashboard?

**Answer:** The Dashboard can be used to create custom views of social media account engagement actions by selecting from a variety of 'filters'. These filters can be used to select accounts by geography (Regions or a sub-set of Countries) by language, or by organizational hierarchy (e.g. BBG >> VOA >> VOA English). These filters can be used in combination with one another and multiple selections can be made within each filter to create individual reports. 

Individual accounts are always listed in a separate table at the bottom of each aggregate report for review. Clicking on an individual account name will show a more detailed breakdown view of the account engagement action data.

**Question:** Why are some numbers in the dashbaord different from the numbers on Facebook Insights ?

**Answer:** Facebook Insights data aggregates additional 'Likes' and 'Comments' from shared Posts. This data is not available through the Public Facebook API used to generated the numbers in this dashboard.
