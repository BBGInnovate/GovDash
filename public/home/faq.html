    <p><strong>Question:</strong> What are Engagement Actions?</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Engagement Actions are an aggregate of 'one-time' user actions taken on an account page or on content posted to a social media platform over a selected date range. For Facebook Pages, engagement actions measure New Fan Page Likes as well as Likes, Comments and Shares on Posts. For Twitter Accounts, New Followers, ReTweets, Favorites and @ Replies are measured. For Youtube Channels, New Subscribers, Video Likes and Comments.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> How is the data aggregated?</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> For Facebook Posts, engagement actions are tracked and aggregated over a period of 28 days. For Tweets and Youtube videos, it's 7 days.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> How do I use the Dashboard?</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Dashboard can be used to create custom views of social media account engagement actions by selecting from a variety of 'filters'. These filters can be used to select accounts by geography (Regions or a sub-set of Countries) by language, or by organizational hierarchy (e.g. BBG &gt;&gt; VOA &gt;&gt; VOA English). These filters can be used in combination with one another and multiple selections can be made within each filter to create individual reports. </p>

    <p>Individual accounts are always listed in a separate table at the bottom of each aggregate report for review. Clicking on an individual account name will show a more detailed breakdown view of the account engagement action data.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why are some numbers in the dashboard different from the numbers on Facebook Insights ?</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Facebook Insights data aggregates additional 'Likes' and 'Comments' from shared Posts. This data is not available through the Public Facebook API used to generated the numbers in this dashboard.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Where can I find more data about my individual accounts on each platform?</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
