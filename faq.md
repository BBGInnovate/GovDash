##How do I use the Dashboard?
The Dashboard can be used to create custom views of social media account engagement actions by selecting from a variety of 'filters'. These filters can be used to select accounts by geography (Regions or a sub-set of Countries) by language, or by organization structure, down to the language service level. These filters can be used in combination with one another and multiple selections can be made within each filter to create individual reports based on the end user needs. 

Individual accounts are always listed in a separate table at the bottom of each aggregate report for reviewing. Clicking on an individual account name will show a more detailed breakdown view of the account engagement action data.
